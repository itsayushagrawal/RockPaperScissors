# 🚀 My First Kotlin Project: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮

You may notice a lot of useless stuff, it is just because i created this project in AndroidStudio
Welcome to the epic world of Rock-Paper-Scissors in Kotlin! 🪨📄✂️



## How the Game Works

- **Rock crushes scissors.**
- **Scissors cuts paper.**
- **Paper covers rock.**

It's a classic battle of wits and randomness! Make your choice and see if you can outsmart the computer.
